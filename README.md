# Fallout2_Script_Viewer
Fallout2 Script Viewer written in PHP

script_parse.php - main script
config.php - contains 2 paths
- ROOT_SCRIPTS_PATH - path where scripts are located (.ssl)
- ROOT_DIALOGS_PATH - path where dialogs are located (.msg)


Still has bugs. i.e. can replace already replaced macros, thus breaking markup.
